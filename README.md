## Florence Hapgood

I am a conscientious and energetic Software Developer. After graduating with a First in Art History from Nottingham University, I was an actor for several years. To support myself, I was a private tutor of piano, maths and English. After discovering coding in my spare time, I decided to retrain as Software Developer. I have recently completed a 12 week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy, and I’m now looking for a job in a charity. 

## Skills

#### Technical paragraph about problem solving and tech: Blank for now.

#### Communication

Articulation and communication are some of my strongest skills. As an actor, put myself in someone elses shoes. Similar skills were necessary when I was teaching, as I had to adapt to the learning style of my students and understand why they were having problems understanding a topic. Additionally, I studied Art History at university, which is a very word subject! I am confident in my ability to explain technical issues to people who are not from a tech background and to communicate effectively with my co-workers. 

#### Adaptability

When the time came to work out how to support myself as an actor, I quickly realised that the main demand in the tutoring industry was for Primary maths, English (subjects that I hadn’t studied in years) and piano. I decided it was necessary to let go of my idea of tutoring art history and adapt to the demand. I did a lot of research into how to teach those subjects and the current syllabus requirements, and ultimately built a thriving tutoring business 


#### Perseverance 

I chose to go to university rather than pursue further acting training. I didn’t have the support of a drama school to launch me into the industry, nor their advice to guide me. I spent four years writing to casting directors – often four times a day - to persuade them to let me audition for their projects. Over the years, I built up a body of work doing this that ultimately allowed me to sign with a prominent acting agent. With maturity I feel my desire to be an actor has been satisfied, but I’m glad that I don’t have to feel that the hardships of the industry got the better of me.
