## Florence Hapgood

I am a conscientious and energetic Software Developer. After graduating with a First in Art History from Nottingham University, I was an actor for several years. To support myself, I was a private tutor of Piano, Maths and English. After discovering coding in my spare time, I decided to retrain as Software Developer. I have recently completed a 12 week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy, and I’m now looking for job where I can continue to develop my skills and contribute to a company.

## Skills

#### Communication

Articulation and communication are some of my strongest skills. As an actor, it was, of course, crucial to be able to put myself in someone else's shoes. Similar skills were necessary when I was teaching, as I had to adapt to the learning style of my students and understand why they were having problems understanding a topic. Additionally, I studied Art History at university, which is a very wordy subject! I am confident in my ability to explain technical issues to people who are not from a tech background and to communicate effectively with my co-workers. 

#### Adaptability

When the time came to work out how to support myself as an actor, I quickly realised that the main demand in the tutoring industry was for Primary Maths, English (subjects that I hadn’t studied in years) and Piano. I decided it was necessary to let go of my idea of tutoring art history and adapt to the demand. I did a lot of research into how to teach those subjects and the current syllabus requirements, and ultimately built a thriving tutoring business 

#### Perseverance 

As I chose to go to university rather than pursue further acting training, I didn’t have the support of a drama school to launch me into the industry, nor their advice to guide me. I spent four years writing to casting directors – often up to four times a day - to persuade them to let me audition for their projects. This involved attempting to find out what was being produced, whether or not there was a part which I would be siutable for, who to write to and how to contact them. Over the years, I built up a body of work doing this that ultimately allowed me to sign with a prominent acting agent. With maturity I feel my desire to be an actor lessenned, but I still feel proud of how I tackled the hardships of the industry.
