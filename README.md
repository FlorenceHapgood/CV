## Florence Hapgood

I am an energetic, enthusiastic and sometimes ecstatic Software Developer, with a fondness for alliteration. After graduating with a First in Art History from Nottingham University, I was an actor for several years. To support myself, I was a private tutor of Piano, Maths and English. While searching for an outlet for my love of complex problem solving, I discovered coding. I have recently completed a 12 week software development bootcamp at Makers Academy, and I'm now looking for a Full-Stack job in a warm and friendly environment.

## Skills

#### Quality Code

At Makers, the focus was on building good quality code. Makers has turned me into a developer who currently uses OOP and TDD, and values principles such as DRY and the Single Responsibility Principle. While I'm open to other ways of working, I'm very happy to have a strong programming foundation and ability to work in these ways. 

#### Communication

Articulation and communication are some of my strongest skills. As an actor, it was crucial to be able to put myself in someone else's shoes. I am therefore able to communicate very effectively with my co-workers, a skill which has served me well during pair programming sessions. Similar skills were necessary when I was teaching, as I had to adapt to the learning style of my students and understand why they were having problems understanding a topic. It is now necessary to apply these techniques to myself, as I am constantly learning something new or trying to solve a bug. Diagnosing the gaps in my knowledge, articulating them, and (often) communicating my questions to others are areas I excel at. I predict that my tutoring background will give me the ability to explain technical concepts to people who are not from a tech background, and I'd be interested in exploring this skill in the future.

#### Adaptability

When the time came to work out how to support myself as an actor, I quickly realised that the main demand in the tutoring industry was for Primary Maths, English (subjects that I hadn’t studied in years) and Piano. I decided it was necessary to let go of my idea of tutoring art history and adapt to the demand. I did a lot of research into how to teach those subjects and the current syllabus requirements, and ultimately built a thriving tutoring business. I am the first ex-actor that they've had at Makers, and the fact that I've been able to learn programming despite coming from a vastly different background shows my ability to learn quickly. 

#### Perseverance 

As I chose to go to university rather than pursue further acting training, I didn’t have the support of a drama school to launch me into the industry, nor their advice to guide me. I spent four years writing to casting directors – often up to four times a day - to persuade them to let me audition for their projects. This involved attempting to find out what was being produced, whether or not there was a part which I would be suitable for, who to write to and how to contact them. Over the years, I built up a body of work doing this that ultimately allowed me to sign with a prominent acting agent. With maturity my desire to be an actor lessened, but I still feel proud of how I tackled the hardships of the industry.
